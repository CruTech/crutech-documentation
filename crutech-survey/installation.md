## Installation

### Cloning the Project

Open a new Git Bash window.  
Simply clone the project to the directory by using the following in the Git bash command line:

```text
git clone https://github.com/CruTech/crutech-survey
```

### Installing NPM packages

{% hint style="info" %}
For this next step, make sure you have NodeJS installed and an Internet connection because this requires downloading software packages.
{% endhint %}

When the cloning is complete, in that Git Bash terminal window using an internet connection type the following into the command line:

```text
npm install
```

When you run this command, Node will look at the package.json file and will download package by package.
